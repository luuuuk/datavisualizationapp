## Idea

The data you enter will be saved **only locally**, on the very device you enter it. There is no communication involving your data with any servers, your data will stay in your hands.
Add your data for four different activity types, see your stats, set goals and follow your progression:

1. Activities:
- Running
- Cycling
- Climbing
- Hiking
- Skiing

2. Stats:
- weekly overview (with retroview of previous weeks)
- monthly overview (with retroview of previuos months)
- 12 weeks overview
- annual overview (with retroview of previous years)
- average speed of the last 25 activities in the categories **Running** and **Cycling**

3. Goals for a specific activity type, for a specific time span and for a specific goal type:
- time span:
  - weekly goals
  - monthly goals
  - annual goals
- goal type:
  - distance
  - time
